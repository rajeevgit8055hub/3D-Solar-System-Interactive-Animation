# 🌌 3D Solar System Animation using Pure HTML & CSS

I'm thrilled to announce the launch of my latest frontend project — a complete, visually dynamic 3D Solar System Simulation, designed and developed entirely using HTML and CSS — without writing a single line of JavaScript.

This isn’t just a visual design — it's a live demonstration of how far creativity and code can go together, purely through frontend technologies.

## <span id="about-the-project">🛰️ About the Project</span>  

At the core of this animation is a glowing Sun, surrounded by revolving planets including Mercury, Venus, Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and more.

### What sets this simulation apart:

- 🌍 **Earth has its own Moon**, revolving through a **nested orbit system**
- 🌀 **Two rotating purple galaxies** in the background create cosmic depth
- ☄️ **A falling star** animates dynamically across the scene
- ✨ **Dozens of twinkling stars** simulate the vastness of space

All of this is built with **CSS animations (`@keyframes`)**, custom gradients, absolute positioning, and responsive units — **without any JavaScript**.

## <span id="key-features">🔧 Key Features</span>  

✅ **Pure CSS Animations**  
All planetary orbits, falling stars, and background motion are powered entirely by `@keyframes`, transforms, and transitions.

🌍 **Earth–Moon Orbit System**  
A realistic double orbit where the Moon orbits Earth, and Earth orbits the Sun.

☀️ **Planetary Revolution**  
Each planet revolves at its own speed and distance to simulate realism.

🌀 **Two Rotating Galaxies**  
Purple spiral galaxies give the universe a sense of motion and dimension.

☄️ **Falling Star Effect**  
A dynamic shooting star animated with CSS variables.

✨ **Twinkling Stars**  
Subtle flickering of star elements to reflect a living universe.

📱 **Responsive Design**  
Fully responsive across all screen sizes — desktop, tablet, and mobile.
